# ðŸš€ Solar System Travel - SQL Project (ongoing) ðŸš€

## Project Overview
This an ongoing project is focused on **practicing SQL and database design** by modeling and managing space travel routes within the solar system. The goal is to create a database system that:
- tracks interplanetary travel routes
- calculates travel times based on spacecraft speeds
- accounts for the constantly changing positions of planets due to their orbits

## Key Features
- **Interplanetary Route Tracking**: Store travel routes between planets and other celestial bodies.
- **Travel Time Calculation**: Compute travel durations considering spacecraft speeds and the dynamic distances between planets.
- **Orbital Distance Calculation**: Utilise **Astropy** to determine real-time orbital distances between planets and adjust travel routes accordingly.
- **Spacecraft Data Management**: Store information on spacecraft, including their speed, fuel capacity, and travel restrictions.
- **Planetary Motion Consideration**: Account for the changing relative positions of planets over time when determining travel feasibility and duration.

## Technology Stack
- **Database**: SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- **Data Analysis & Calculation**: Python with Astropy
- **Backend**: TBD (for possible future API development)
- **Frontend**: Future consideration (Vue.js or React)

## Current Focus
The main focus right now is **designing the database schema** and working out the logic for **calculating interplanetary travel times**. Future improvements may include API development and a frontend interface, but these are not immediate priorities.

## Next Steps
- Design and refine the database schema to efficiently store route and spacecraft data.
- Research and implement methods for calculating planetary distances dynamically using Astropy.
- Develop SQL queries to simulate different travel scenarios.
